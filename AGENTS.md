# Agent Instructions for YouTube Channel Monitor

This document provides guidance for AI agents working on this repository.

## Project Overview

This project automatically monitors a list of YouTube channels, fetches their latest videos, and displays them on a static website hosted via GitHub Pages. The entire process is automated using a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Key Files

-   **`scripts/fetch_latest_videos.py`**: The core Python script that fetches video data from the YouTube API. This is the main piece of application logic.
-   **`data/channels.json`**: A JSON file containing the list of YouTube channels to monitor. To add or remove a channel, edit this file.
-   **`docs/videos.json`**: The JSON output generated by the Python script. This file contains the video data that the frontend website consumes. **Do not edit this file directly**, as it is overwritten by the script.
-   **`docs/index.html`**: The main HTML file for the static website.
-   **`docs/style.css`**: The stylesheet for the website.
-   **`docs/script.js`**: The JavaScript that fetches `videos.json` and dynamically populates the webpage.
-   **`.github/workflows/update-videos.yml`**: The GitHub Actions workflow that automates the execution of the Python script and commits the updated `videos.json` file.

## Local Development and Testing

To run the video fetching script locally:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Set the API Key:** You need a YouTube Data API v3 key. Export it as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export YOUTUBE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/fetch_latest_videos.py
    ```
4.  **Verify the output:** Check the contents of `docs/videos.json` to ensure it has been updated correctly.

To test the frontend, you can use a simple local web server to serve the `docs` directory. For example, using Python:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory docs 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Workflow Automation

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/update-videos.yml` is configured to run on a schedule and can also be triggered manually. It automates the steps described in the "Local Development" section and commits any changes to `docs/videos.json` back to the repository, which automatically updates the GitHub Pages site.
